# DanyAPI

OpenAI compatible HTTP API built on Python + FastAPI. Instead of the paid APIs it talks to the internal APIs of the free web clients, and to the free tier of GigaChat.

## Public hosted instance

A public instance is already running in production (BYOK_MODE=1):

- API base URL: `https://danyapi.cloudpub.ru/v1/`

Point any OpenAI compatible client at API base URL with a valid tokens, unauthenticated requests are rejected with 401. The API key should be the raw token (e.g. "token1,token2", same in .env). The `alice`, `alice-ai`, `yagpt` and Duck.ai models need no key and are reachable without one; DeepSeek, Qwen, GigaChat and OpenCode Zen models return 401 without a key. `GET /health` reports every provider as enabled in this mode, with `byok_api_key_required` naming the ones that need a key.

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://danyapi.cloudpub.ru/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token1,token2,token3" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-v4.1-flash-thinking",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hi from example request!"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Install & Upgrade

Requires Python 3.10+.

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FANATFANATA/DanyAPI/prod/docs/install.ps1 | iex
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FANATFANATA/DanyAPI/prod/docs/install.sh | bash
```

Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  -e DEEPSEEK_TOKENS="token1,token2" \
  -e QWEN_TOKENS="token3" \
  -e GIGACHAT_KEYS="<authorization_key>" \
  -e OPENCODE_KEYS="<zen_api_key>" \
  -e ALICE_ENABLED=1 \
  -e DUCKAI_ENABLED=1 \
  ghcr.io/fanatfanata/danyapi:latest
```

## Run locally

Clone or download the repo, install the dependencies, then start the server from the DanyAPI folder:

```bash
python app.py
```

Two equivalent entry points, both reading the same `.env`:

```bash
python -m danyapi
python docs/start.py
```

`app.py` and `python -m danyapi` start the server as is. `docs/start.py` first pulls the latest GitHub release (see `DANYAPI_AUTO_UPDATE`), then starts it, and it is what the desktop shortcut runs. In a git checkout the update is refused and the reason printed when the working tree has uncommitted changes, and the resolved tag commit is compared against the `origin` remote before the checkout is moved.

Defaults: binds `0.0.0.0:8000`, so the API is at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/`, the landing page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and the health check at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`.

## Configuration

All settings live in `.env` at the repo root. `docs/setup.py` writes it for you, and `.env.example` lists every key the server reads together with its default, so the shipped example and `danyapi/config.py` are cross-checked by the repository guards. `.env` is git-ignored and holds your tokens, so keep it out of version control.

## GigaChat

`GigaChat-2` (Lite), `GigaChat-2-Pro`, `GigaChat-2-Max`, `GigaChat-3-Lightning`, `GigaChat-3-Pro` and `GigaChat-3-Ultra` are served from the official GigaChat API at `https://api.giga.chat/v1`, which speaks the OpenAI chat completions format. The list is read from `GET /models` at startup, so it follows whatever your account is granted. Every new GigaChat project starts with a free freemium quota.

Get the authorization key in the GigaChat Studio account under "Настройки API". It is the base64 of `client_id:client_secret`, not the secret on its own:

```bash
GIGACHAT_KEYS="<authorization_key>"
```

Access tokens live 30 minutes and are refreshed automatically. GigaChat issues its certificates under the Russian Trusted Root CA, which is absent from most Python CA bundles, so a root CA is shipped in `danyapi/gigachat/russian_trusted_root_ca.pem` and combined with the system roots at runtime. Point `DANYAPI_GIGACHAT_CA_FILE` at your own bundle to override it.

Differences from the OpenAI API to keep in mind: function calling uses the legacy `functions` plus `function_call` pair, which DanyAPI maps from `tools` for you, there is no `n`, `seed`, `stop` or penalty support, and images are uploaded to the GigaChat file storage first, one image per message and ten per request.

Images work on the Pro, Max and Ultra tiers only. `GigaChat-2` and `GigaChat-3-Lightning` are Lite models and reject attachments; the bridge turns that into a 400 naming the models that accept images instead of a raw upstream error.

## OpenCode Zen

The OpenCode Zen gateway at `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1` is a curated list of models the OpenCode team tested and benchmarked as coding agents, spanning GPT, Claude, Gemini, GLM, Kimi, MiniMax, Qwen and DeepSeek families. The list is read from `GET /models` at startup, so it follows whatever Zen currently serves.

Get a key by signing in at `https://opencode.ai/auth`:

```bash
OPENCODE_KEYS="<zen_api_key>"
```

Zen is metered per token rather than free. A set of models is on a free tier, and those are listed with `free` marked in `/v1/models`, but reaching them needs an account: `GET /models` answers with or without a key, so it cannot tell a good key from a bad one, and a key is only judged on the first real request. A rejected key returns `401`, and the account is set aside and retried on the usual revive cooldown instead of the server refusing to start.

To reach the free tier, set `OPENCODE_ENABLED=1` and leave `OPENCODE_KEYS` empty, or put the sentinel `public` in `OPENCODE_KEYS`. Either way one account comes up, the first sending no `Authorization` header at all. The flag is ignored once `OPENCODE_KEYS` holds anything. In BYOK mode a caller who sends no key gets the keyless account instead of a `401`. Do not reach for a made up placeholder instead: Zen rejects an unrecognised key on the free models too rather than ignoring it, so any other value turns a working free tier into a `401`.

Zen also accepts the literal key `public`, which is what OpenCode itself sends when it has no account, and which the gateway treats as a request with no key at all rather than as a credential. Captured off the wire from OpenCode 1.18.33 running keyless, the request it makes is `Authorization: Bearer public`, `User-Agent: opencode/1.18.33 ai-sdk/provider-utils/4.0.23 runtime/bun/1.3.14`, `x-opencode-client: cli`, `x-opencode-project: global`, plus a `x-opencode-session` and `x-opencode-request` pair. This provider sends that same set, with `x-opencode-client` reading `danyapi` rather than `cli`.

What the free tier does not have. Only `space-bunny-free` answers without a key, reliably, and it is the one free model the free tier is reachable through here. Every other free model refuses with `FreeTierError: OpenCode's free tier can only be used from within OpenCode`, `muse-spark` refuses with `RegionError` outside the region, and the models.dev names that Zen no longer serves answer `ModelError`. OpenCode reaches those models with no account, three runs out of three, and this provider could not reproduce it: replaying OpenCode's captured headers and its 75 KB body byte for byte answered `200` twice, through a raw socket and through httpx, and then answered `403` for the same bytes across six consecutive rounds while OpenCode kept answering `200`. Headers, the system prompt, the tool set, streaming and the transport were each ruled out in turn, and Node answered `403` where OpenCode answered `200`, so whatever the gateway is checking is not on the wire in a form that can be copied. Replaying those models is not attempted. Use `space-bunny-free` without a key, or the paid catalogue with one.

The catalog is read from `models.opencode.ai/api.json`, the models.dev mirror Zen publishes, rather than from `GET /models`, because the mirror carries what the gateway does not. It reports each model's request format as a `provider.npm` field, so the 84 ids the gateway advertises narrow to the 28 this gateway actually serves, the other 56 needing `/responses` or `/messages`; it reports `cost`, so the free tier is identified as `input` and `output` both zero rather than by guessing from the name; and it carries the context window, the display name and whether the model takes images. A mirror that cannot be read leaves the plain `GET /models` list in place.

Two things about routing. Zen model ids collide with the other providers, `qwen3.8-max` and `deepseek-v4.1-flash` are both a real Qwen model and a real Zen model, so a bare model name goes to the Qwen or DeepSeek provider as before. Prefix the id with `opencode/` to force the Zen route, as in `opencode/qwen3.8-max`. Every other Zen id, `space-bunny-free` for instance, resolves on its own with no prefix.

Zen splits its catalogue over three request formats: `chat/completions` for the `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` models, `responses` for the OpenAI ones and `messages` for the Anthropic ones, and it refuses a model on the wrong format with a `ModelError`. This provider speaks `chat/completions`, so only the compatible half of the catalogue is usable and the rest answers with a `404` naming the format mismatch. `GET /models` lists all of them, so filter on that response if you want to hide the unreachable half.

The upstream sends the model identification headers OpenCode itself sends, `x-opencode-client`, `x-opencode-session` and `x-opencode-request`, along with the OpenCode `User-Agent`. Measured against the live gateway those are not what gates access, and the earlier assumption that they were is wrong: the only header that decides anything is `User-Agent`, because Cloudflare in front of Zen refuses a `Python-urllib` signature with `403 error code: 1010` before the request reaches the API. Any other `User-Agent` gets through. The header set is kept anyway, since it costs nothing and matches what the real client sends.

Upstream errors are typed in the body, `AuthError`, `FreeTierError`, `RegionError`, `ModelError` and `BillingError` among them, and the status is taken from the type rather than the code. That matters because `ModelError` arrives with `401`, and treating the code as authoritative would report a wrong model name as a bad key.

Differences from the OpenAI API to keep in mind: only `chat/completions` is spoken, which is why the list is filtered to the models that use it; there is no `n`, `logprobs` or `top_logprobs`; file attachments are rejected, images go inline as `image_url` parts; and system and developer messages are folded into one leading `system` message.

## Yandex Alice, unofficial

`alice`, `alice-ai` and `yagpt` route to the Yandex Alice consumer endpoint `wss://uniproxy.alice.yandex.net/uni.ws`. It needs no key, no account and no token.

Read this before enabling it. Yandex has no public API for this, so the provider speaks an undocumented internal protocol of a consumer service, and `yandex.ru/legal/alice_chat` clause 4.2 forbids circumventing technical protections and imitating the service's functioning. Yandex also versions and reshapes this protocol without notice, so the provider can break at any time. It is disabled unless you set `ALICE_ENABLED=1`, which is your acknowledgement of the above.

Behaviour to expect from the answers: the endpoint is stateless, so the whole conversation is folded into one prompt; it routes prompts across scenario handlers rather than to a single model, so many prompts get a canned Alice reply or a persona refusal instead of an answer; and there is no incremental text, so streaming sends the finished text in a single chunk. A request needs at least one message. `max_tokens` is honoured by trimming the answer and reporting `finish_reason` `length`. There is no `n`, `top_p`, `logprobs`, `top_logprobs`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty` or `logit_bias`, and no tool calling: tools in the request are ignored, so a tool-enabled client gets prose back. A deterministic refusal is reported as `400` without retrying, while an upstream stall is reported as `502` after the retry budget.

## Duck.ai, unofficial

The free-tier Duck.ai models, currently `mistral-small-2603`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `tinfoil/gemma4-31b`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `tinfoil/gpt-oss-120b` and `claude-haiku-4-5`, route to DuckDuckGo's public Duck.ai chat at `https://duck.ai/duckchat/v1`. The list is not fixed: it is parsed from the model table the Duck.ai web bundle currently ships, filtered to the models DuckDuckGo grants the free tier, and refetched on the model refresh interval. It needs no key, no account and no token.

Read this before enabling it. DuckDuckGo has no public API for this, so the provider speaks an undocumented internal protocol of a consumer service, and the attestation it demands is a browser fingerprint. The Duck.ai terms at `https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/duckai` forbid circumventing technical protections and imitating the service's functioning, and DuckDuckGo reshapes this protocol without notice, so the provider can break at any time. It is disabled unless you set `DUCKAI_ENABLED=1`, which is your acknowledgement of the above.
It does work, and it was measured end to end through the real HTTP surface on a host with no proxy: nine of twelve consecutive requests answered with real model output, streaming included. Two things make that possible and are easy to get wrong. duck.ai compares the build identifier in `x-fe-version` against the one it is currently serving, so the provider reads it from the landing page on startup; a stale value is refused as an unsupported entrypoint. And every request carries a proof that a real browser made it, computed by evaluating a script DuckDuckGo serves fresh on each request against a browser environment. The solver in `danyapi/duckai/jsa_solver.js` reproduces that environment: DOM prototype chain, error and stack API, a box model, and an HTML fragment parser. Some of those scripts are HTML parser differentials that only a real parser answers correctly, so a minority of requests is refused with `403` and an explanation. The provider re-solves a freshly served attestation and retries those, keeps a startup miss from stopping the server, and never disables the account over one.

Now the part worth planning around. After a few dozen automated requests in a row, DuckDuckGo stops judging the proof and refuses the client outright: `ERR_BN_LIMIT`, the same "unsupported entrypoint" wording, returned in about a tenth of a second, before any attestation is evaluated. A real Chrome on the same host kept answering normally throughout, and roughly twenty minutes of quiet did not clear it. So this is not your address being blocked and not a solver bug; it is DuckDuckGo deciding a Python client is a client, and the decision is sticky. The honest reading is that a provider which has to impersonate a browser will be recognised eventually, and there is no amount of header tuning in Python that changes that, because what is missing is a browser engine, not a header. Treat this provider as something that works interactively and in light use, not as a dependable backend route, and keep the other providers for anything that has to be reliable.

Differences from the OpenAI API to keep in mind: there is no `system` role, so system and developer messages are folded into the first user turn; `reasoningEffort` is clamped to what the chosen model supports, which is read from the same live table as the model list; there is no `n`, `seed`, penalty or `response_format` support; images must be inline data URIs, at most three per message and ten per request, and file attachments are rejected; and there is no usage accounting upstream, so token counts are estimated from the text. Tool calls are native, and web search and image generation are switched off because the free tier does not grant them.

## Mistral Le Chat, unofficial

The free Le Chat models, currently `mistral-small-latest`, `mistral-medium-latest`, `mistral-large-latest`, `magistral-medium-latest`, `codestral-latest` and `mistral-ocr-latest`, route to Le Chat at `https://chat.mistral.ai/api/chat`, the same surface the Android app speaks. Le Chat no longer answers anonymous sessions, so the provider logs in with an account: set `MISTRAL_LOGINS` to `email:password` pairs and the client negotiates an Ory session token on startup, refreshes it with a fresh login when it expires, and always creates chats incognito so they never land in the account history.

Read this before enabling it. Mistral has no public API for this, so the provider speaks an undocumented internal protocol of a consumer service, and Mistral reshapes it without notice, so the provider can break at any time. Free accounts are rate limited per message count: when the cap is hit the request is reported as `429` with an explanation. It is disabled unless you set `MISTRAL_ENABLED=1` and at least one login, which is your acknowledgement of the above. In BYOK mode the same `email:password` pairs travel in the `Authorization` header instead, one pool per key set.

Differences from the OpenAI API to keep in mind: the endpoint is stateless per request, so the whole conversation is folded into one prompt with XML role tags, and system and developer messages are folded into its head; there is no `n`, `top_p`, penalty, `logprobs` or `top_logprobs` support; file attachments are rejected; the model named in the request is echoed back because Le Chat picks its own serving model; and there is no usage accounting upstream, so token counts are estimated from the text. Tool calls are emulated through prompt injection: tools are described in the prompt and a `<tool-call>` reply is parsed back into `tool_calls`.

## Google AI Studio, unofficial

The AI Studio web chat at `https://aistudio.google.com` is served through its internal MakerSuiteService RPC. Requests need a Google account session plus a BotGuard attestation token that is bound to the prompt text, so the provider drives a real Camoufox browser: it logs in with an account, runs the AI Studio front end, and mints one token per request. Chat traffic itself goes over `alkaliMakerSuite` with a DNS-over-HTTPS resolver, because the RPC answers `403 Region not supported` when the host resolves to some Google edges.

Read this before enabling it. Google has no public API for this, so the provider speaks an undocumented internal protocol of a consumer service, and the BotGuard gate is an anti-abuse mechanism; the provider does not bypass it, it runs the same front end a browser runs. Google reshapes this protocol without notice, so the provider can break at any time. It is disabled unless you set `AISTUDIO_ENABLED=1` and at least one `AISTUDIO_LOGINS` entry, which is your acknowledgement of the above.

```bash
AISTUDIO_ENABLED=1
AISTUDIO_LOGINS="you@gmail.com:password"
```

Camoufox is not installed with the base requirements. Install it and its browser once, then set `AISTUDIO_HEADLESS=0` for the first run if the account needs an interactive step and log in by hand; after that the saved state in `AISTUDIO_STATE_DIR` is reused:

```bash
pip install camoufox
camoufox fetch
python app.py
```

Differences from the OpenAI API to keep in mind: `n`, `seed`, `response_format`, penalties, `logprobs` and `top_logprobs` are rejected; file attachments are rejected; tools in the request are ignored, so a tool-enabled client gets prose back; system and developer messages are folded into the head of the first user message; and there is no usage accounting upstream, so token counts are estimated from the text.

## Server-side tools, MCP

The server can execute tool calls itself instead of handing them back to the client. Configure it once and any OpenAI compatible client gets working tools, even against providers with no native tool support, because the server runs the tool-call loop and returns a finished answer.

```bash
DANYAPI_MCP_SEARCH_ENABLED=1
MCP_SERVERS=fetch=uvx mcp-server-fetch,github=https://mcp.example.com/mcp
```

`MCP_SERVERS` entries are `name=command` for stdio servers, where the command is spawned locally, or `name=url` for streamable HTTP servers. Entries are comma-separated, a comma inside the command is escaped as `\,`, and at most 16 servers are loaded. A server that fails to start or exposes no tools is skipped with a warning rather than blocking the server.

`DANYAPI_MCP_SEARCH_ENABLED=1` adds the built-in `web_search` tool, which queries DuckDuckGo's HTML endpoint with no API key and returns titles, URLs and snippets. Set `DANYAPI_MCP_ITERATIONS` to bound the loop, the default of 8 means at most 8 model rounds per request.

Send `"mcp": true` in a `POST /v1/chat/completions` body to run the loop for that request, `"mcp": false` to opt out when tools are configured. With no flag the loop runs whenever tools are configured. Streaming is refused with a 400 for MCP requests, because the answer is only final after the loop ends: send `stream=false`. The configured tools are appended to whatever `tools` the request carries, so client tools keep working and are executed server-side too, and `tool_choice` defaults to `auto`. Token usage is summed across every round and reported in the final response.

A round works like this: the request goes to the provider as usual, tools included; if the answer carries `tool_calls`, the server executes each call against the MCP server that owns the tool, appends the results as `role: tool` messages and asks the provider again; a plain answer ends the loop. A tool that fails or does not exist returns its error text as the tool result, so the model can recover instead of the request failing. When the iteration limit is hit mid-loop the last model message is returned with a note naming the limit.

In BYOK mode the loop works the same: the `"mcp"` flag travels in the request body, the model requests authenticate with the caller's own key from the `Authorization` header, and every iteration draws from that caller's pool. MCP servers themselves are a host resource: they are read from `MCP_SERVERS` in the server's `.env` and executed on the server, a request cannot register its own. Keep that in mind before enabling `MCP_SERVERS` on a public instance, because every caller would be able to trigger host-side tool execution; the built-in `web_search` is the safer one to expose.

## Models

Model lists are not hardcoded. Every provider is asked where it runs and the answer is what `GET /v1/models` serves:

| Provider | Source | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DeepSeek | `model_configs` in the web client settings at `scope=model` | none |
| Qwen | `GET /api/v2/models/` on the account | a token gives the account list, without one it serves the visitor list |
| GigaChat | `GET /models` on the official API | authorization key |
| OpenCode Zen | the models.dev mirror at `models.opencode.ai`, for format, cost and context | API key, `space-bunny-free` answers without one |
| Duck.ai | the model table in the Duck.ai web bundle, filtered to the free tier | none |
| Alice | the provider's own aliases, upstream serves no catalog | none |
| Mistral Le Chat | the provider's own catalog, upstream serves no model list to anonymous sessions | none |
| AI Studio | `ListModels` on the internal MakerSuiteService RPC | Google account session |

The lists are fetched at startup and refetched every `DANYAPI_MODELS_REFRESH_SECONDS`, and a fetch that fails or comes back empty keeps the last good list rather than emptying `GET /v1/models`. Send `?refresh=1` to `GET /v1/models`, or pass a key in `Authorization` or `x-api-key`, to force a refetch right now and, for GigaChat, to read the list your own key is granted.

Only models the upstream marks enabled are listed, so a DeepSeek model type the account is not given does not appear. DeepSeek ids are its `model_type` values, `default` today, with a `-thinking` sibling for each that toggles reasoning; `deepseek-v4.1-flash` still resolves as an alias of the default one. In BYOK mode the keyless providers are catalogued from the same endpoints without any key, and GigaChat joins the list as soon as a request arrives with a key.

OpenCode Zen is the one provider with two ways to name the same model. `GET /v1/models` returns the bare id, and a bare id is what routes, but an id that another provider also owns needs the `opencode/` prefix to say which one is meant.

## Token utility

The installer asks for provider tokens by hand, but `docs/token_utility.py` reads them out of your browser for you. It starts a small local server on `127.0.0.1:8765`, walks you through DeepSeek and then Qwen, and shows both tokens in the browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/results`, where each one has a copy button. Paste them into `.env` yourself; the tool never writes to it. It needs no dependencies, and nothing leaves your machine.

Linux/macOS:

```bash
sh docs/token_utility.sh
```

Windows:

```
docs\token_utility.bat
```

Or run it directly with any Python 3.10+ interpreter:

```bash
python docs/token_utility.py
```

Use `--port` to move it off the default port and `--no-browser` to skip opening the page. The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only and keeps running until you stop it with Ctrl+C in the window it runs in, or close that window.
